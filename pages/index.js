            I built a CRM mobile app, and connected it to its Java back-end API.
            Using Ionic 4 and Angular 2, the UI is efficient, inspired by the 
            current CRM web app, but adapted to a mobile environment.
            The app was be tested on Android and iOS, on smartphone and tablet.

            To start selling their solution, the MasterMined startup, based in the US,
            needed an interface to connect to their AI powered backend API.
            Because of future interviews with investors, they needed a functionnal
            demo in less than two weeks. I helped them reach that goal.<br/> 
            Targeted at lawyers and legal professionals, the UI needed to be clean,
            easily understandable and responsive. From a design mockup, I
            built the entire frontend as a React/NextJS Web app. It features a full authentication
            system, a multiple file uploader for AI analysis, and various document
            organizer and visualization solutions.<br/>
            Thanks to NextJS capabilities, the app was made very quickly, while staying
            very fast and scalable. It was first deployed on a free Heroku server, to
            be used as a small demo system, but can then be deployed on a CDN, for a very
            fast worldwide delivery.<br/>
            Since my contribution, MasterMined past their first round of seed investment.
            They are now expanding the app even more.

            To manage work time between their volunteers, the non-profit RND4IMPACT used to write
            check-in and check-out time on paper. With the Covid pandemic, they were forced to go
            remote. They needed an official ID verification method, so common time tracking software
            was not an option. I designed for them a custom responsive time tracking web app,
            with official international ID verification, work contract e-signature, check-in/check-out,
            and administration at different level of authorization.
